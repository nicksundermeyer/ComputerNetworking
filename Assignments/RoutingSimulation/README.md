Information here about the state of our project.

We were able to get most of the pieces working, but it's not fully complete. Running the simulation program will set up a number of routers in parallel on different threads. We have two different type of packets, a regular data packet (created in the demo file) which just contains test data and a source and destination. The other type is a control packet, which contains the 2d array of node weights used to calculate the algorithm. Packets first send out their control packets to their neighbors, and then calculate the bellman ford algorithm on the incoming packets if they are a control packet, and otherwise just print out the incoming values for test purposes. Our bellman ford algorithm is not fully complete, as we had a lot of trouble with testing it running on different threads with overlapping calculations and printouts, so the weights don't properly balance as they should. We believe that we got close to the final working version, as we have all the other pieces (threads, control packets, routers sending data over sockets, and the demo sending in data packets) working properly, but we weren't able to get the full algorithm to work.
